### What is Rach5?
**Rach5** (that's _Rach_ as in _Rach_-maninov) is a WordPress theme boilerplate developed by Chris Van Patten for Van Patten Media.

### Why should I care?
Frankly, you probably shouldn't. It seemed like a nice, non-offensive way to kick off our GitHub page though.

### What do I need?
**Rach5** requires the following Ruby gems...

*   <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>
*   <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/net-ssh">Net-SSH</a>
*   <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/net-sftp">Net-SFTP</a>

And of course you need WordPress, as this is all pretty useless without it.

### TODO
*   I have a bunch of fancy functions I reference in functions.php that I need to reinclude
*   Comments, as they stand now, don't exist in public/are a mess in private.
    *   I have problems with including presentational functions in functions.php, which is how it's currently done in WordPress. There have to be ways to navigate around that...
*   There are some new Ruby gem requirements that need to be noted
*   I need to rethink SASS organization. /includes, /structure, and /pages are a good start but could be more flexible
*   Moar HTML5.
*   As of now I don't include any responsive components, because I don't want to get involved in endorsing any CSS frameworks or anything. I think I could avoid that by writing some basic media queries and throwing them in a SASS file, which is what I often do anyway.
*   Logo!
