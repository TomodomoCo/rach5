### What is Rach5?
**Rach5** (that's _Rach_ as in _Rach_-maninov) is a WordPress theme boilerplate developed by Chris Van Patten for Van Patten Media.

### Why should I care?
Frankly, you probably shouldn't. It seemed like a nice, non-offensive way to kick off our GitHub page though.

### What do I need?
**Rach5** requires the following Ruby gems...

*   <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>
*   <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/net-ssh">Net-SSH</a>
*   <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/net-sftp">Net-SFTP</a>
*   <a href="https://github.com/aaronrussell/compass-rgbapng">rgbapng</a>

And of course you need WordPress, as this is all pretty useless without it.

### Getting started
It's easy! Follow along:

1.  Install Ruby and RubyGems
2.  Install the required gems (see above for a list)
3.  Edit the following files so your Rach5 setup reflects you:
    *   humans.txt
    *   config.rb
    *   style.css
4.  Install WordPress and set up a permalink structure (we don't do it for you)
5.  Upload Rach5
    *   A word of warning: **do _not_ under _any circumstances_ upload config.rb** â€“ your password is in there!
6.  Activate Rach5
7.  Enjoy Rach5!

### TODO
*   Comments, as they stand now, don't exist in public/are a mess in private.
    *   I have problems with including presentational functions in functions.php, which is how it's currently done in WordPress. There have to be ways to navigate around that...
*   I need to rethink SASS organization. /includes, /structure, and /pages are a good start but could be more flexible
*   Moar HTML5!
*   Logo!

### DONE
*   I borrowed lots (and modified it all) from Roots, a great WordPress theme framework. I like Roots a lot, but it's not suited for my purposes... I need something lighter, that makes fewer assumptions on what settings I need, which is why I am developing Rach5. Still, it has a lot of great features, and I've incorporated a small chunk into Rach5.
*   <del>I have a bunch of fancy functions I reference in functions.php that I need to reinclude</del>
    *   They're back and they're awesome.
*   <del>As of now I don't include any responsive components, because I don't want to get involved in endorsing any CSS frameworks or anything. I think I could avoid that by writing some basic media queries and throwing them in a SASS file, which is what I often do anyway.</del>
    *   I'm not explicitly including any full frameworks, but I have decided to include the responsive media queries from <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>. Skeleton is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>.
*   <del>There are some new Ruby gem requirements that need to be noted</del>
    *   rgbapng is now noted prominently. Things will probably break if you are without it.
