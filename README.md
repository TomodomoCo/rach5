### What is Rach5?
**Rach5** (that's pronounced _Rock_ as in _Rach_-maninov) is a WordPress theme boilerplate developed by Chris Van Patten for Van Patten Media.

Rach5 provides a set of "sensible defaults" that make it faster to jump into developing a custom WordPress website, and get right out of your way as quickly as possible by not imposing any (well, almost any) style decisions. Rach5 uses HTML5, Ruby and Compass, and a mix of WordPress native and custom functions that make theme development fast and fun.
