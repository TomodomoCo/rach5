### What is Rach5?
*Rach5* (that's _Rach_ as in _Rach_-maninov) is a WordPress theme boilerplate developed by Chris Van Patten for Van Patten Media.

### Why should I care?
Frankly, you probably shouldn't. It seemed like a nice, non-offensive way to kick off our GitHub page though.

### What do I need?
*Rach5* requires the following Ruby gems...

*   <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>
*   <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/net-ssh">Net-SSH</a>
*   <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/net-sftp">Net-SFTP</a>

And of course you need WordPress, as this is all pretty useless without it.
